README: Complete LBO Model
What is an LBO Model?
An LBO Model is a financial model used to evaluate the acquisition of a company primarily funded through debt (leverage). The goal is to estimate the returns to the equity investors after paying off debt over time, based on the company’s future cash flows.

Purpose of the LBO Model
To analyze the feasibility of acquiring a company with debt.

To forecast the company’s financial performance and cash flows post-acquisition.

To estimate the internal rate of return (IRR) and multiple on invested equity (MOIC).

To assess the impact of different financing structures, operational improvements, and exit scenarios.

Key Components of the LBO Model
Transaction Assumptions:

Purchase price (Enterprise Value)

Debt financing (types, amounts, interest rates)

Equity contribution

Transaction fees and expenses

Assumed exit year and exit multiple

Sources and Uses of Funds:

Sources: Debt tranches, equity, seller financing, etc.

Uses: Purchase price, refinancing old debt, transaction fees, working capital adjustments.

Financial Projections:

Historical and forecasted Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement (usually 5-7 years)

Revenue growth assumptions

Margins (COGS, SG&A)

CapEx, working capital changes, and tax rate assumptions

Debt Schedule:

Debt tranches with principal, interest rate, amortization schedule

Interest expense calculations

Mandatory and optional debt repayments (amortization and refinancing assumptions)

Cash Flow Waterfall:

Calculation of free cash flow available for debt repayment

Debt paydown schedule from free cash flow

Exit Assumptions:

Exit year (typically year 5 or 7)

Exit multiple (EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue)

Calculation of exit Enterprise Value and equity proceeds

Returns Analysis:

Equity value at exit

IRR calculation on equity invested

MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital)

Step-by-Step Process to Build the LBO Model
Step 1: Input Historical Financials and Make Assumptions
Gather historical financial data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).

Define revenue growth rates, margins, CapEx, working capital needs.

Assume financing structure (debt and equity mix, interest rates).

Step 2: Construct Sources & Uses Table
Detail how the acquisition is financed and where funds are applied.

Step 3: Build Pro Forma Financial Statements
Project income, balance sheet, and cash flows post-acquisition for 5-7 years.

Step 4: Build Debt Schedule
Define each debt tranche’s principal, interest, repayment schedule.

Calculate interest expense and principal repayments.

Step 5: Calculate Free Cash Flow Available for Debt Repayment
Adjust EBIT for taxes, add back non-cash charges, subtract CapEx and working capital changes.

Step 6: Model Debt Repayments & Interest Payments
Apply free cash flow to repay debt according to the debt schedule.

Step 7: Model Exit
Calculate exit Enterprise Value using exit multiple.

Subtract remaining debt to get equity value at exit.

Step 8: Calculate Returns to Equity Investors
Compute IRR and MOIC based on initial equity invested and equity proceeds at exit.

Key Assumptions and Variables to Test
Purchase price multiple (e.g., EV/EBITDA)

Entry and exit multiples

Revenue growth rates

EBITDA margins

Debt structure (interest rates, amortization terms)

Exit year

CapEx and working capital changes

Tax rate

Outputs and Metrics
Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Annualized return on equity investment.

MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital): Total equity return multiple.

Debt Paydown Schedule: How quickly debt is repaid.

Cash Flow Projections: Operational and free cash flow over time.

Sensitivity Analysis: Impact of key assumptions on returns.

Common Uses of LBO Model
Private equity deal evaluation.

Leveraged acquisitions feasibility.

Capital structure optimization.

Strategic planning for buyout transactions.

Tips for Building a Robust LBO Model
Use detailed, realistic operating projections.

Model multiple debt tranches with different terms.

Include mandatory and optional repayments.

Stress test key assumptions with sensitivity analysis.

Link all statements dynamically.

Validate IRR calculations carefully.

Clearly show all input assumptions for easy adjustments.
